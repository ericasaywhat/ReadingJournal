The general solution to this problem is to specify a **machine model** and analyze the number of steps, or operations, an algorithm requires under a given model\n",
    "        \n",
    "        ii. Relative performance might depend on the details of the dataset (ie some sorting algorithms run faster if the data are already partially sorted; other algorithms run slower in this case. (to avoid this problem: analyze the worst case scenario, but that's usually harder, and it might not be obvious what set of cases to average over)\n",

    "        iii. relative performance also depends on the size of the problem. (ie sorting algorithm that is fast for small lists might be slow for long lists; a solution: express run time as a function of problem size adn compare the functions asymptotically as problem size increases.)\n",
